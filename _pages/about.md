Computational Epidemiology
======
Malaria due to the *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite continues to be a major public health concern, causing about 241 million cases per year, and about 627 thousand deaths. Children under five face some of the highest disease burden, despite international investment in interventions such as vector control programs targeting *Anopheles* mosquitoes, preventative chemotherapies, vaccine research and development, and case management using artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). One growing concern is the development of resistance by the parasite to ACTs necessitating the use of spatial, individually-based models to assist National Malaria Control Programmes and partner organizations to ensure the therapeutic efficacy of ACTs.

Complex Systems
======
Systems such as cities, stock markets, ecosystems, the climate, and so forth are the result of many components interacting with each other in ways that may or may not be predictable. These interactions may in turn lead to emergent phenomenon whose behavior is observable, but not always predictable given the components of the system in isolation. Understanding these systems and development tools for modeling them is of major importance as societies plan for the future and react to global climate change.
