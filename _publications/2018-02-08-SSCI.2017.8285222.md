excerpt: 'This paper presents the development and application of a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to an agent-based model of non-industrial private forest owner (NIPFO) timber harvesting activity. The FIS inputs and rules are developed based upon survey and literature data on NIPFOs and agents are embedded into a forested landscape similar to real conditions. Model results indicate harvesting patterns similar to what is actually observed. I argue that these encouraging results indicate the technique merits further development.'
