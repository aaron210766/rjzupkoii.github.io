excerpt: "Malaria due to the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasite remains a threat to human health despite eradication efforts and the development of anti-malarial treatments, such as artemisinin combination therapies. Human movement and migration have been linked to the propagation of malaria on national scales, highlighting the need for the incorporation of human movement in modeling efforts. Spatially couped individual-based models have been used to study how anti-malarial resistance evolves and spreads in response to drug policy changes; however, as the spatial scale of the model increases, the challenges associated with modeling of movement also increase. In this paper we discuss the development, calibration, and validation of a movement model in the context of a national-scale, spatial, individual-based model used to study the evolution of drug resistance in the malaria parasite."
